    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone! This is the "about me" section, I'm not quite sure what to put here. Should I put things that make me look good on a resume, with amazing flow of words, turning things like "I make really good sandwiches" into "ablilty to create wonderfully exquisite creations by blending flavours and memorizing recipes into grand performances of art for all to enjoy!"? Or do I write about myself, the way I see me? I think I'm gonna do a bit of both, because that's usually the best way to go. So, without further ado, here it goes:</p>

    <p>Hi! I'm Liam, I'm about to turn 20, and life for me has been pretty good. I'm currently in my dream major (sports management) and am learning a marketable skill (computer science) as hopefully my second major. I make pretty good food because I didn't want to live off of frozen corn in university, I can play the piano quite well but only if the songs are old 80's rock songs (I don't know why but they sound the best on the piano). I like reading about various things, I recently have been getting into "astrophysics for dummies", it's quite nice. I know happiness>money any day of the week, and base most of my decisions over this one fact. I love working ahrd on things, and love seeing my work come to fruition. I go to the gym frequently and have seen good results, and can explain everything you need to know about lifting in probably 2 minutes (it's what I major in, I had to do this for an assignment one time). So there it is, a summary about who I am that is less than 200 words! Yay! </p>
